The dawn breaks soft on the quiet land <br>
A golden stretch at the farmer's hand.  <br>
The earth, so rich, so wide, so deep,  <br>
<p>Holds the secrets it will keep.  <br></p>

With weathered hands and steady eye,  <br>
He plants the seeds, then looks to sky.  <br>
The soil, a canvas, worn yet true,  <br>
Whispers life in every hue.  <br>

The plow cuts through the morning dew,  <br>
Turning earth that’s fresh and new,  <br>
While cattle low and roosters crow,  <br>
And rivers gently onward flow.  <br>

A labor born of sweat and grace,  <br>
Of patience written on each face.  <br>
The sun, it climbs, the moon will rise,<br>  
But the farmer's work will never die.  <br>

Through seasons' shifts, the crops will grow, <br> 
In sun and rain, through ice and snow.  <br>
A harvest ripe, a gift of toil,  <br>
A bond that's rooted in the soil.  <br>

So here’s to fields, to furrows deep,  <br>
To sowing seeds and promises to keep,  <br>
For every harvest, every year,  <br>
Is planted with a quiet prayer and cheer. <br>
